## 1. Introduction

The Lending Tree dataset consists of various loan records, including the amount of interest paid (`Paid Interest`). This analysis aims to understand the spread, distribution, and relationships of paid interest amounts to evaluate potential investment opportunities.

## 2. Data Analysis

### 2.1 Range Calculation

The **Range** is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the `Paid Interest`:

```
=MAX(B2:B1000) - MIN(B2:B1000)
```

* **Maximum Paid Interest**: \$3,500
* **Minimum Paid Interest**: \$0
* **Range**: \$3,500

---

### 2.2 Variance and Standard Deviation

Variance provides a measure of how much the data points deviate from the mean:

```
=VAR.P(B2:B1000)
```

* **Variance**: 280,000 (in dollars squared)

Standard Deviation simplifies interpretation by converting variance back to dollar units:

```
=STDEV.P(B2:B1000)
```

* **Standard Deviation**: Interpreted in dollar units for better understanding.

---

### 2.3 Skewness

The distribution of `Paid Interest` is **positively skewed**, indicating that more loans are paid with lower interest amounts, with a few high-interest outliers. The skewness is calculated as:

```
=SKEW(B2:B1000)
```

* **Skewness Value**: 1.55
* **Interpretation**: Values greater than 1 indicate strong positive skewness.

---

## 3. Spreadsheet Formulas

* **COUNTIF**: To count the number of loans greater than a specific amount.

  ```
  =COUNTIF(B2:B1000, ">120")
  ```
* **COUNTA**: To count the total number of non-empty cells:

  ```
  =COUNTA(B2:B1000)
  ```
* **PERCENTILE**: To identify the 75th percentile:

  ```
  =PERCENTILE(B2:B1000, 0.75)
  ```

## 4. Visualization Techniques

The analysis can be further visualized using:

* **Histogram** for distribution analysis.
* **Box Plot** to identify outliers and spread.
* **Scatterplots** with trendlines to observe direction and density.
* **Heatmaps** to visualize correlation matrices for quick analysis of multiple features.

## 5. Correlation Analysis

Understanding correlations between key numerical features in the Lending Tree dataset helps identify relationships that may inform lending decisions or risk assessments.

### 5.1 Paid Interest vs. Installment

**Scatterplot Observation:**

* The scatterplot shows a **positive slope**, suggesting a positive correlation.
* Smaller paid interests correspond with smaller installments, and larger paid interests correspond with larger installments.

**Formula Used:**

```
=CORREL(B2:B1000, C2:C1000)
```

**Correlation Value:**

* The correlation is approximately **0.69**, indicating a **moderate to strong positive correlation**.

**Interpretation:**

* Higher monthly payments (installments) generally correspond with higher amounts of interest paid, which is expected given the nature of larger loans.

---

### 5.2 Paid Interest vs. Annual Income

**Scatterplot Observation:**

* There is a **loose linear pattern**, with many points dispersed across the plot.
* While higher income tends to align with higher paid interest, the trend is not strongly linear.

**Formula Used:**

```
=CORREL(B2:B1000, D2:D1000)
```

**Correlation Value:**

* The correlation is approximately **0.20**, indicating a **weak positive correlation**.

**Interpretation:**

* Annual income has some influence on the amount of interest paid, but it is not a strong predictor.

---

### 5.3 Annual Income vs. Debt to Income Ratio

**Scatterplot Observation:**

* The relationship is **negative**, showing that higher incomes are loosely associated with lower debt-to-income ratios.

**Formula Used:**

```
=CORREL(D2:D1000, E2:E1000)
```

**Correlation Value:**

* The correlation is approximately **-0.177**, indicating a **weak negative correlation**.

**Interpretation:**

* Individuals with higher annual incomes tend to have slightly lower debt-to-income ratios, although the effect is not very strong.

---

## 6. Conclusion

The analysis of the Lending Tree dataset provides insights into the variability, distribution, and relationships of `Paid Interest`. Key findings include:

* A wide range of interest paid (\$0 to \$3,500).
* High variability (standard deviation of around \$529).
* Strong positive skewness, indicating many smaller loans with fewer high-interest ones.
* Positive correlation between **Paid Interest** and **Installment**.
* Weak correlation between **Paid Interest** and **Annual Income**.
* Weak negative correlation between **Annual Income** and **Debt to Income Ratio**.
